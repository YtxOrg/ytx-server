# YTX Server

YTX Server is a Rust-based backend server that provides WebSocket communication, database management, and Vault integration for secure credential handling. It is designed for high concurrency and security, leveraging async Rust and modern libraries.

## Features

- **WebSocket Server:** Handles real-time client connections and messaging.
- **Database Hub:** Manages PostgreSQL connections and SQL generation.
- **Vault Integration:** Securely retrieves and renews secrets from HashiCorp Vault.
- **Configurable:** Uses environment variables for flexible deployment.
- **Async & Scalable:** Built with Tokio for high performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable recommended)
- PostgreSQL database
- HashiCorp Vault (for secret management, optional)
- Initial Database Setup (MUST RUN FIRST)
  - Before starting the server, you **must** initialize the authentication and main databases, as well as create required PostgreSQL roles and permissions.
  - For detailed instructions, please refer to [ytx-initdb](https://github.com/YtxErp/ytx-initdb).

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/YtxErp/ytx-server.git
    cd ytx-server
    ```

2. **Configure environment variables:**

    - Copy `env_template.text` to `.env` and fill in your values.
    - Example variables:

        ```env
        BASE_POSTGRES_URL=postgres://localhost:5432
        VAULT_ADDR=<http://127.0.0.1:8200>
        VAULT_TOKEN=your-vault-token
        LISTEN_ADDR=127.0.0.1:8080
        AUTH_DB=ytx_auth
        AUTH_READWRITE_ROLE=ytx_auth_readwrite
        AUTH_READWRITE_PASSWORD=your-password
        ```

3. **Build the project:**

    ```sh
    cargo build --release
    ```

4. **Run the server:**

    ```sh
    cargo run --release
    ```

## Usage

- The server listens for WebSocket connections on the address specified by `LISTEN_ADDR`.
- It connects to PostgreSQL using credentials from Vault or environment variables.
- WebSocket sessions are managed in [`src/websocket/session.rs`](src/websocket/session.rs).
- Database operations are handled via [`src/dbhub/`](src/dbhub/).

## Development

- Code is organized by feature (config, dbhub, message, vault, websocket).
- Use `.env` for local development configuration.
- See [`src/main.rs`](src/main.rs) for application startup logic.
